[Matching Messy Pandas columns with FuzzyWuzzy](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/matching-messy-pandas-columns-with-fuzzywuzzy-4adda6c7994f)

* Identified and resolved a missing edge case in the article, "Matching Messy Pandas Columns with FuzzyWuzzy," published on Medium by Analytics Vidhya and written by Khalid El Mouloudi ([2020]).
* Collaborated with the author to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential use cases, improving the article's accuracy and completeness.
* Detailed Solution: Author Presented solution to data problem of matching Pandas Columns using Python Package Fuzzy Wuzzy. Although an informative article, there was a missing edge case / (data type) to be considered - _nulls_. Discussed with author that not only strings of _Null_ or _NaN_ should be considered but actual value types that are _null_ which affected the shape of dataframes when conducting the nlp comparison. Author was able to update the issue and generously credited myself with a contribution in the matching data solution.

## Data Science Projects

### Computer Vision Projects
[Face Detection on AI Generated Images](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/tree/main/Face_Detection_on_AI_Generated_Images)
* Face detection on AI images. Classification/decomposition of image to find real faces vs. AI-generated faces

### Healthcare Prediction Project:
[Predicting Hypertension](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/tree/2093d0f8eacd5b659ca3a5d3557b715c9a2854c8/Hypertension)  

* Data engineered public health data
* Optimized different models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Aritficial Nerual Networks to predict target variable (blood pressure)
* Using metrics from output of model, insights gave information to predict Hypertension
* Further analysis not only shared prediction to Hypertension but features (symptoms) that strongly cause the disease.
