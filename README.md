## Contributions
[Matching Messy Pandas columns with FuzzyWuzzy](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/matching-messy-pandas-columns-with-fuzzywuzzy-4adda6c7994f)

* Identified and resolved a missing edge case in the article, "Matching Messy Pandas Columns with FuzzyWuzzy," published on Medium by Analytics Vidhya ([2020]).
* Collaborated with the author to ensure comprehensive coverage of all potential use cases, improving the article's accuracy and completeness.

## Data Science Projects

### Computer Vision Projects
[Face Detection on AI Generated Images](https://github.com/ddaviddn/cda_fall2023_project)
* Face detection on AI images. Classification/decomposition of image to find real faces vs. AI-generated faces

### Healthcare Prediction Project:
[Predicting Hypertension](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Hypertension%20%26%20Symptoms.ipynb)  

* Data engineered public health data
* Optimized different models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Aritficial Nerual Networks to predict target variable (blood pressure)
* Using metrics from output of model, insights gave information to predict Hypertension
* Further analysis not only shared prediction to Hypertension but features (symptoms) that strongly cause the disease.

### Contribution to published article from Medium - Analytics Vidhya:
[Matching Messy Pandas columns with FuzzyWuzzy](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/matching-messy-pandas-columns-with-fuzzywuzzy-4adda6c7994f)

* Background - Author Presented solution to data problem of matching Pandas Columns using Python Package Fuzzy Wuzzy. Although an informative article, there was a missing piece (data type) to be considered - nulls. Had brought up the problem - not just records that contained strings of "Null" or "NaN" but actual nulls which affected the shape of dataframes when conducting comparison. Author was able to resolve issue and credited myself with a small contribution within the matching data solution.
