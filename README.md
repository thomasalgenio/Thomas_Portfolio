## Data Science Projects

### Prediction Projects:
* Data engineered public health data
* Optimized different models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Aritficial Nerual Networks to predict target variable (blood pressure)
* Using metrics from output of model, insights gave information to predict Hypertension
* Further analysis not only shared prediction to Hypertension but features (symptoms) that strongly cause the disease.

### NLP Sentiment Analysis Projects:
* Web Scraped unstructured text data from multiple sources (e.g. Amazon Reviews, Yelp Restaurant Reviews, Twitter hashtags, etc.)
* Cleaned, Transformed, and Formatted data to be reusable in modeling process
* Optimized different models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Unigrams to output the best results
* Business Decisions explored using model results

### Regression Projects:
* Data engineered public data
* Optimized different models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Aritficial Nerual Networks to predict continuous target variable
* Used metrics from models to understand key insights and predict future outcomes
