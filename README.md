# Thomas Algenio Data Science Portfolio
## Data Science Projects

### Healthcare Prediction Project:
[Predicting Hypertension](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/Predicting%20Hypertension%20%26%20Symptoms.ipynb)  

* Data engineered public health data
* Optimized different models including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Aritficial Nerual Networks to predict target variable (blood pressure)
* Using metrics from output of model, insights gave information to predict Hypertension
* Further analysis not only shared prediction to Hypertension but features (symptoms) that strongly cause the disease.

[Yelp Resturaunt Reviews](https://github.com/thomasalgenio/Sample_Projects/blob/main/NLP%20Sentiment%20Analysis%20Yelp%20Restaurant%20Reviews.ipynb)  

* Web Scraped unstructured text data from multiple sources (e.g. Amazon Reviews, Yelp Restaurant Reviews, Twitter hashtags, etc.)
* Cleaned, Transformed, and Formatted data to be reusable in modeling process
* Optimized different models including Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Unigrams to output the best results
* Business Decisions explored using model results
